HOW TO GRADLERIO:
  Note: Make sure your terminal/command prompt is in the
  same directory as the gradlew/gradlew.bat files...

  1) To run gradle, type:
    gradlew               (Windows)
    ./gradlew             (Mac/Linux/UNIX)

    Not working? Try gradlew.bat for Windows.

  2) To setup WPILib, run:
    gradlew       wpi     (Windows)
    ./gradlew     wpi     (Mac/Linux/UNIX)

  3) To setup your workspace, do the following:
    -for IntelliJ IDEA:
      gradlew     idea    (Windows)
      ./gradlew   idea    (Mac/Linux/UNIX)

      Open the .ipr file in IntelliJ, or double click to open it
    -for Eclipse:
      gradlew     eclipse (Windows)
      ./gradlew   eclipse (Mac/Linux/UNIX)

      Point your eclipse workspace to this directory

    Dependencies aren't loaded?
      Dependencies are located in ${USERHOME}/wpilib/extracted/library/
      Try adding them manually.

  4) To deploy code to the RoboRIO, do the following:
    -Check all settings in build.gradle are accurate
    -Make sure you are connected to the same network as the RIO
    -Run the following command
      gradlew     deploy  (Windows)
      ./gradlew   deploy  (Mac/Linux/UNIX)

    Not working?
      The plugin most likely can't find the RIO. Try running 'gradlew deployIP'
      instead if the RIO is connected with the included Wireless bridge.
      If this still doesn't work, uncomment the lines in the build.gradle that
      allow you to specify the IP address of the RIO, and then run 'gradlew deployIP'
      again
